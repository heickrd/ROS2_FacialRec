# ROS2 Facial Recognition Project
Week One: 
  -Finished syllabus for class and worked on literature review
  
 Week Two-Three:
  -Began installing ROS 2.  Had some issues setting up ROS on personal laptop as Virtual Machine was incompatible with ROS 2. Acquired a school laptop to install on instead. 
  -Worked through ROS 2 tutorials.
    -TODO: Need to install ROS onto school laptop
    
 Week Four: 
 -Installed Facial Recognition library
 -Recognition Library Found here: https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/09/24/opencv-face-recognition/
 -Added myself to the dataset and trained the software on my face.
 -Tested the software at various angles, distances, lightings, etc. The software works realiably up to about 10 feet straight on and about 5 feet from an angle facing up from the ground. Though when placed at the average height of a turtlebot the reliablity went up to about 7 feet. I believe that a larger dataset will increase performance at range.
 -Worked on getting output from the software for later use.
 -Added more faces to the dataset and the software easily distingushes between people up close. Once again I believe that increasing the dataset will increase performance at larger distances.
 
 -TODO: Integrate the software into a ROS environment
 
 -Possible Research Concept: Finding the minimum necessary dataset size to have software running optimally. 
 
 Plan for next week:
  
 -Begin working on project. Get robot to move and integrate mapping systems.
